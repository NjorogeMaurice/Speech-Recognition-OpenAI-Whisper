# Speech-Recognition-OpenAI-Whisper
This project is a web-based application that utilizes OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text conversion. The application allows users to upload audio files or record audio directly from their browser, and then converts the speech in these audio files to text using the Whisper model.

## Features 

- **Audio Upload**: Users can upload audio files in various formats (e.g., MP3, M4A, WAV) for speech recognition. 

- **Audio Recording**: Users can record audio directly from their browser using the microphone, with support for starting, stopping, and submitting the recording.

- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: The uploaded or recorded audio is processed by OpenAI's Whisper to convert speech to text.

- **Real-time Transcription**: The application provides real-time transcription of audio files, displaying the transcribed text to the user.
